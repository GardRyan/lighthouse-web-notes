Objects = hold data
  

object.keys 
  The title of the category in the object (keys) 

object.entries
  All entries in the object (entries)

object.values
  the categorical values held. i.e. title = "this!" value is "this!"

Methods vs Function

functions are a set of operations that are independent

methods are a function scoped to the object

esxample:
const bobTheBuilder = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 42,
  powerLevel: 9001,
  occupation: "builder",
  greet: function () {
    console.log(
      `Hi! My name is ${this.name}, I'm ${this.age}, and I work as a ${this.occupation}.`
    )
  }
}

//THIS works within that object so if the object name changes, you can keep the formula and it'll work.
